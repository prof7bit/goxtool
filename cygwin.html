<h1>Installation of goxtool.py on Windows with cygwin</h1>

<p>Since goxtool.py depends on ncurses (python-curses) and there exists no
native version of ncurses for Windows it is necessary to use cygwin. Cygwin is
a collection of tools which provide a Linux look and feel environment for
Windows, it has some tools and libraries which are not natively available for
windows and ncurses is one of them. Visit the cygwin website <a name="http"
href="http://www.cygwin.com/" id="http">http://www.cygwin.com/</a> and download
the cygwin installer <span class="codeword">setup.exe</span>.</p>

<p>Cygwin has a package manager and you only need to install the packages that
are needed to run this application. After you started setup.exe and selected
install location (leave this at the default) and preferred download mirror you
can select which packages to install. For installing goxtool you need these 3
packages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="codeword">python</span></li>
  <li><span class="codeword">python-crypto</span></li>
  <li><span class="codeword">git</span> (git is only used to install goxtool
    and pull updates, its not strictly needed to run goxtool but you want to
    install it anyways to be able to proceed with the steps below)</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep the setup.exe you downloaded around for later, if you decide to install
even more packages or remove packages you use the same setup.exe tool to modify
your cygwin installation. The following screen shots illustrate it on an old
Windows XP system (I did not have any other Windows around here but it should
be pretty much identical on any later version of Windows):</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot: Select git package for installation"
src="cygwin01.png" width="731" height="588" /></p>

<p>It will then download and install these packages along with a bunch of other
packages that are needed dependencies. All the stuff will be installed into the
<span class="codeword">c:\cygwin\</span> folder (just in case you wonder what
all these unix path names like <span class="codeword">/usr/bin/whatever</span>
mean on a Windows system: its all inside the cygwin folder which will emulate
the root <span class="codeword">/</span> of a unix file system. There you will
also later find your home folder (in the terminal it will be abbreviated with a
tilde <span class="codeword">~</span> and its real physical location will be in
<span class="codeword">c:\cygwin\home\yourname\</span> and goxtool will also be
installed inside this folder).</p>

<p>After successful installation you should find a shortcut to the cygwin
terminal. Open the cygwin terminal and install goxtool:</p>
<pre>git clone git://github.com/prof7bit/goxtool.git</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Now change into the goxtool folder <span
class="codeword">~/goxtool</span></p>
<pre>cd goxtool</pre>

<p>and start it</p>
<pre>python goxtool.py</pre>

<p>Note that unlike described on the main goxtool website we unfortunately
cannot start it with ./goxtool.py because it will not find the executable
python2 from the shebang, there is only python on cygwin (which is the same) so
we just manually invoke the python interpreter by calling its name. This also
applies to all other commands from the main website or mentioned on the forums:
</p>

<p>Wherever it says: <span class="codeword">./goxtool.py --some-options
--what-ever</span><br />
simply replace it with: <span class="codeword">python goxtool.py --some-options
--what-ever</span></p>

<p>I have made a screen shot of the steps above:</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot: Install goxtool with git and then start it"
src="cygwin03.png" width="800" /></p>

<p>and now goxtool should start and can be used normally as described in the
user manual (make sure the terminal windows is large enough so it won't do ugly
line breaks. If everything is done right it will look like in the screen shot
below and now you can continue with the instructions in the main user manual,
just remember that when it cannot find python2 then start it with python like
explained above.</p>
